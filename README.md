# VisuaLing
VisuaLing is an app that relies on machine learning and uses a model to recognize objects through the camera.
It allows users to process information in a graphical form; once they point at an object, its name is displayed on the screen. They can also switch languages to see the object's name in various languages and listen to its pronunciation with the touch of a button.
